###
Python (Django) program that automatically creates database schemas based on single json abstraction. The purpose is to ensure easy business reconfiguration and development by modifying existing models or adding new ones without affecting or interrupting the web application. The idea is to create a graph(tree) of tables on which all queries are dynamically constructed.
